bitentropy.py measures how stable each bit of each coefficient of a given "k03b0band" is accross runs. this script runs after a generatewfc version that produces five different files for each k-point/band combination.
byteentropy.py measures how redundant each file is, meaning how much a byte is repeated inside a file (analysis integrated within generatewfc.py)
